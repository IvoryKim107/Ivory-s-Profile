# Ivory-s-Profile
This is my first profile project in Front-End Web Development.
When I was younger I wanted to become a computer programer, but instead I completed a degree in Communication/ Journalism.
The only explonation for making the change is that I wanted to write. I wanted to write stories, songs, books and plays. 
I have a vivid imagination and I always think outside of the box. 
Originally it seemed like a great idea. I was on my way to becoming the greatest writer that ever lived. Until I realized that there were a lot more aspiring writers than there were jobs.
